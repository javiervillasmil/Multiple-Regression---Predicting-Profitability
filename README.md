Multiple Regression - Predicting Profitability

1.	SCOPE
Analyze using the dataset supplied by the CTO and head of Blackwell's eCommerce Team – the goal is to predict sales volume and profitably of a list of new products. 
This dataset contains information about different product types that Blackwell sells, as well as important attributes for their classification (price, reviews, product size, margin, etc.)

2.	OBJECTIVES
•	Clean, transform and preprocess the dataset.
•	Determine relationships between variables. 
•	Verify and select important features used in the predictive models.
•	Optimize and tune the selected algorithms.
•	Predict sales volume and profitability of Blackwell’s potential new products.

3.	METHODOLOGY
The approach used to assess the dataset was to apply basics methods of data mining, descriptive statistics and simple charting to observe the distribution and correlation between variables in our dataset.
In addition, R / Rstudio helped with the evaluation of histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrixes, and with the cleaning / transformation of the data.
On the other hand, for the predictive models, the algorithms used were Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (rf), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosted Tree  (GBT), these algorithms were tuned according to each own parameters.
To decide the best-fitted model, error metrics such as Root mean squared error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squares were used.
